## Da Nang

I came from the beautiful city of [Danang, Vietnam](http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/da-nang/first-time/pagePropertiesImage/da-nang.jpg). It's called the city of bridges, like way too many, including:

* a [Dragon Bridge](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/dragon-bridge-da-nang/index.html) that can breathe fire and shoot water lolz,
* a [Golden Bridge](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298085-d14991251-Reviews-Golden_Bridge-Da_Nang.html)
* and my most favorite [Tran Thi Ly bridge](https://danangfantasticity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tranthily-pa1-01.jpg)


I proudly attended [Le Quy Don Highschool For The Gifted](https://goo.gl/maps/fwt5F3cgZNNVFbzR6) (if you look closely on google maps, you'll see it's shaped like a microscope).
