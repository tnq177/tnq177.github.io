## Da Nang

I came from the beautiful city of [Danang, Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang){:target="_blank"}. It's called the city of bridges, like way too many, including:

* a [Dragon Bridge](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/dragon-bridge-da-nang/index.html){:target="_blank"} that can breathe fire and shoot water lolz,
* a [Golden Bridge](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298085-d14991251-Reviews-Golden_Bridge-Da_Nang.html){:target="_blank"}
* and my most favorite [Tran Thi Ly bridge](https://danangfantasticity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tranthily-pa1-01.jpg){:target="_blank"}


I proudly attended [Le Quy Don Highschool For The Gifted](https://goo.gl/maps/fwt5F3cgZNNVFbzR6){:target="_blank"} (if you look closely on google maps, you'll see it's shaped like a microscope).
