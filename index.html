<p>I'm a 4th year PhD student at University of Notre Dame, focusing on (Neural) Machine Translation for low-resource languages. My advisor is <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/" target="_blank">David Chiang</a>.</p>

<p>I used to work as a freelance developer for a company called Tripchum where I was mentored by Christ, the founder, and the rising-author/developer <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15941417.Nguy_n_H_i_Nh_t_Huy" target="_blank">President Huy</a>. Then I spent some time at the wonderful <a href="https://eastagile.com" target="_blank">EastAgile</a>.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://toannq177minor.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">a blog (probably nothing there)</a>. I also once owned an online bookstore business which <a href="http://bookstore-toannguyen177.herokuapp.com/books/6" target="_blank">attracted quite a lot of attention from a bunch of celebrities</a>.</p>
